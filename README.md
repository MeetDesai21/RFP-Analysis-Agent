##  About RFP-Analysis-Agent

RFP-Analysis-Agent is a Jupyter Notebook designed to streamline the process of analyzing Request for Proposal (RFP) documents.  Leveraging powerful natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this tool helps you efficiently extract key information, identify opportunities, and make informed decisions.

## Features

* **Automated Text Extraction:** Effortlessly extract relevant data points like project scope, requirements, timelines, and budget from RFP documents.
* **Keyword Identification & Analysis:**  Identify crucial keywords and phrases to understand the RFP's focus areas and prioritize key responses.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Compare multiple RFPs side-by-side to identify similarities, differences, and potential competitive advantages.
* **Structured Data Output:** Generate structured data from the analyzed RFPs, making it easy to import into databases or other tools for further analysis.
* **Customizable Templates:**  Adapt the analysis process to your specific needs by creating custom templates for different RFP types.
